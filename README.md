# This-Ganyu-Does-Not-Exist
This ProGAN implementation was built on top of the YouTube video from **Aladdin Persson**, who implemented the [ProGAN Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10196) with some modifications. One of the modifications I made was to incorporate the use of WSTransposeConv2d Layers in the generator and discriminator architecture, which were not used in the original implementation. 

**Please note** that the code in this repository is for demonstration purposes only, and only includes the generator for generating images. The training loops and discriminator architectures are not included. With its sophisticated neural network architecture and modifications, this ProGAN is capable of generating high-resolution Ganyu faces with remarkable detail. Ideal for artists, game developers, and fans of Genshin Impact, this ProGAN is a powerful tool for exploring the creative possibilities of deep learning and computer-generated imagery.
